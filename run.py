    And finally a missed tile will be represented by a '0'.

    You and the computer will take turns trading shots until
    all ships on either side has been hit.

    First you will be asked to pick a board size and ship count, it's a good
    idea to keep the ship count below 10 or the game will take a long time to
    finish. However you are free to play with enough ships to fill the entire
    board if you like.

    Next you will place your ships on your side of the board (the lower half).
    The computer will place their ships quietly.
    After setup, when it's your turn, move the cursor with the arrow keys and
    press enter or space to select a position to attack.
    You can quit the game at any time by pressing q or Q on the keyboard"""
